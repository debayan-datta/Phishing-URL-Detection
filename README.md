# Phishing-URL-Detection
Every URL is broken into several parts. Features are extracted from the URs which help ensuring whether an URL is phishing or not. Machine Learning techniques are applied to build an effective model for predicting the legitimacy of the website provided which is further deployed 

You need to deploy the model yourself. Save the model using a pickle file. We used StreamLit to deploy the model.
Inorder to use ngrok, you need to have an account in ngrok. The system commands are given in 'ngrok token' file
